## Description 

In a world *polluted* by Del the Funkee Homosapien's virus,
one code editor endures: Markdown 3030, created and operated by Dan the
Automator. Although Del and Dan have partnered up in this post-apocalyptic
world, Del's virus does not differentiate between friend and foe. Can you
help Dan find the virus before it takes over his server?


## Details

The server is running at {{{{link_as('/', 'here')}} and 
{{url_for("app.js", "app.js is available")}}
