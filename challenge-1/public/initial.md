1. Type in stuff on the left.
2. See the live updates on the right.

That's it.  Pretty simple.  There's also a drop-down option above to switch between various views:

- **Preview:**  A live display of the generated HTML as it would render in a browser.
- **HTML Source:**  The generated HTML before your browser makes it pretty.
- **Lexer Data:**  What marked uses internally, in case you like gory stuff like this.
- **Quick Reference:**  A brief run-down of how to format things using markdown.
